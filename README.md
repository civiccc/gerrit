# Gerrit CLI

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/gerrit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/gerrit)

`gerrit` is Ruby-based tool to make the process of working with
[Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) from the command line more
pleasant.

It is not intended to be used in scripts. Rather, it is intended to reduce the
number of occasions you need to visit Gerrit in a browser by providing powerful
CLI shortcuts.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.0.0+

## Installation

```bash
gem install gerrit
```

Create a [`.gerrit.yaml`](#configuration) configuration file in your home
directory, following the example outlined in the
[Configuration](#configuration) section.

Clone your Gerrit project using `gerrit clone <project-name>`. If you're working with
an existing local repository, you can run `gerrit setup` within your repository
to set it up to push/pull to/from Gerrit (using the [`.gerrit.yaml`](#configuration)
file you've set up previously).

## Configuration

`gerrit` is configured by creating a `.gerrit.yaml` in your home directory.
You can also create separate `.gerrit.yaml` files in each of your repositories,
but this shouldn't be necessary unless you are trying to interact with
different Gerrit users or hosts for each of your repositories.

Here's a commented example configuration that should work for most
organizations.

```yaml
user: john.doe            # Username of your Gerrit user
host: gerrit.example.com  # Host where your Gerrit instance is located
port: 29418               # Port the custom Gerrit SSH daemon is listening on

# Remotes to add when running `gerrit setup`. Note that %{...} values are
# interpolated using the values above--you do not need to fill them in yourself.
remotes:
  # When updating your local repo, all commits are pulled down from this remote.
  # This is also used when force-pushing commits or seeding a Gerrit repo
  # initially (though you'll need to give the respective user force-push permissions)
  origin:
    url: ssh://%{user}@%{host}:%{port}/%{project}.git
    push: HEAD:refs/heads/master
  # Used for pushing commits out for review.
  # While you should use `gerrit push`, this allows you to run `git push gerrit`.
  gerrit:
    url: ssh://%{user}@%{host}:%{port}/%{project}.git
    push: HEAD:refs/publish/master
  # Used to pull down from a repo mirror--in this example GitHub.
  # This is mostly to check that replication from Gerrit to the mirror is working.
  # You should not be pushing to this directly (hence why it has no push spec).
  github:
    url: git@github.com:my-organization/%{project}.git

# Use this remote (from the list above) to push commits out for review
push_remote: gerrit

# Groups to get users from when searching for "all" users. This is necessary
# when a user could potentially be in many groups, since the tool will check
# the memberships of all that user's groups in order to find potential matches.
user_search_groups:
  - 'Registered Users'
```

## Usage

All commands are of the form `gerrit command`, where `command` is from the list
below. By not specifying any command, the default is to run `gerrit list`,
which displays all currently open changes.

* [checkout](#checkout-change)
* [clone](#clone-project)
* [console](#console)
* [groups](#groups)
* [help](#help)
* [list](#list-query)
* [members](#members-regex)
* [projects](#projects)
* [push](#push-ref-reviewer-reviewer-)
* [setup](#setup-project)
* [submit](#submit)
* [version](#version)

### `checkout [change]`

Checks out the latest patchset of a change locally.

```
> gerrit checkout 1337

Finding latest patchset...
Fetching patchset...
You have checked out refs/changes/37/1337/2
```

`change` can be a Change-Id or a change number (i.e. the value in the URL). If
you don't specify on the command line you'll be asked for one.

### `clone [project]`

Clones a Gerrit project, setting up the remotes to push/pull from Gerrit.

```
> gerrit clone my-project

Cloning my-project from ssh://john.doe@gerrit.example.com:29418/my-project.git...
my-project successfully cloned into /home/john/src/my-project

Added origin remote ssh://shane.dasilva@code.brigade.com:29418/foghorn.git
Added gerrit remote ssh://shane.dasilva@code.brigade.com:29418/foghorn.git

You can now push commits for review by running: gerrit push
```

This command saves you the hassle of remembering the exact remote URL for
cloning your Gerrit project.

### `console`

Opens a [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) development console.

```
> gerrit console

    6: def execute
    7:   require 'pry'
 => 8:   binding.pry
    9: end

#<Gerrit::Command::Console> »
```

This is useful for testing client calls when writing new commands by allowing
you to run code within the context of a command's `execute` method.

### `groups`

Lists all groups visible to you.

```
> gerrit groups

Backend Team
Engineering
Web Team
```

### `help`

Displays usage information.

```
> gerrit help

Usage: gerrit [command]
...
```

### `list [query]`

List all changes matching the given query.

```
> gerrit list "status:open AND project:brigade"

┌────┬────┬───┬───────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────┐
│ #  │ CR │ V │ Subject                   │ Owner           │ Project        │   Updated │
├────┼────┼───┼───────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────┤
│ 3  │ ✕  │ ✓ │ Add test script           │ Dave Michaels   │ helper-scripts │ Yesterday │
│ 2  │    │ ✕ │ Implement adapter pattern │ Joe Smith       │ common-libs    │   9:20 AM │
│ 1  │ ✓  │ ✓ │ Remove unused scripts     │ John Doe        │ helper-scripts │  11:15 AM │
└────┴────┴───┴───────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────┘
```

The list is sorted by oldest to most recent so that newer entries are at the
bottom of the list. This makes the UI work better in console environments,
since long lists would require you to scroll to the top of the list every time.

Specifying `query` allows you to filter the results further. By specifying no
query it will display all open changes (i.e. the query defaults to
`status:open`).

### `members [regex]`

Lists all members in the specified group, including their username, full name,
and email.

```
> gerrit members eng

┌──┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ID│Username     │Name         │Email                    │
├──┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│8 │john.doe     │John Doe     │john.doe@example.com     │
│1 │joe.smith    │Joe Smith    │joe.smith@example.com    │
│12│dave.michaels│Dave Michaels│dave.michaels@example.com│
└──┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### `projects`

Lists all projects visible to you.

```
> gerrit projects

All-Users
helper-scripts
my-application
```

This is a light wrapper around the underlying `ls-projects` Gerrit SSH command.
See its [documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/cmd-ls-projects.html)
for examples of additional flags you can specify.

### `push [ref] [reviewer reviewer ...]`

Pushes one or more commits for review.

```
> gerrit push

Are you pushing this as a draft? (y/n) [n] n
Enter topic name (optional; enter * to use current branch branch) my-topic-branch
Target branch [master] master
Enter users/groups you would like to review your changes: backend dave
```

When entering users/groups, the `push` command will split by spaces and treat
each chunk as a regex. It will then first see if that regex matches any groups,
and if it does return add all users from those groups as reviewers.
Otherwise, it will pull users from the groups specified in your
`user_search_groups` configuration option, and return any users that match the
regex.

This ultimately makes it very easy to add reviewers without having to type
their full username, and allows you to tag entire teams for pariticularly
important changes.

Specifying a `ref` and one or more `reviewer`s on the command line will bypass
the prompts, accepting defaults.

### `setup [project]`

Configures the repository's remotes to push/pull to/from the Gerrit server
specified in your `~/.gerrit.yaml` configuration.

```
> gerrit setup

The following remotes already exist and will be replaced:
origin

Replace them? (y/n)[n] y
Added origin ssh://john.doe@gerrit.example.com:29418/helper-scripts.git
Added gerrit ssh://john.doe@gerrit.example.com:29418/helper-scripts.git
Added github git@github.com:example-org/helper-scripts.git

You can now push commits for review by running: gerrit push
```

Specifying the `[project]` allows you to explicitly name the Gerrit
project. By default, this will be the name of the git repo itself, so you
usually won't need to specify this.

### `submit`

Display a list of submittable changes, allowing you to choose one to submit.

```
> gerrit submit

┌────┬────┬───┬───────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────┐
│ #  │ CR │ V │ Subject                   │ Owner           │ Project        │   Updated │
├────┼────┼───┼───────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┼───────────┤
│ 3  │ ✓  │ ✓ │ Add test script           │ Dave Michaels   │ helper-scripts │ Yesterday │
│ 2  │ ✓  │ ✓ │ Implement adapter pattern │ Joe Smith       │ common-libs    │   9:20 AM │
│ 1  │ ✓  │ ✓ │ Remove unused scripts     │ John Doe        │ helper-scripts │  11:15 AM │
└────┴────┴───┴───────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────┘
Which change would you like to submit? (1 - 3) 3
Submitting Add test script (2874)...
```

By default, "submittable" means any change matching the following query:

```
is:open label:Code-Review+1 label:Verified+1 NOT label:Code-Review-1 NOT label:Verified-1
```

If your organization uses different rules for determining whether something is
submittable, specify the `submittable_changes` option in your configuration.

### `version`

Displays the version of this client.

```
> gerrit version
```
